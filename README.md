<b>25 Card Game Windows App
by Darren Flannery</b>

The App allows you to play 1 v 1 game of "25" against the computer.

Follows the rules from this link: http://www.pagat.com/spoil5/25.html

At the moment the computer plays a random card from a list of cards that it is allowed to play based on the opponents played card and the trump card.

I will add in a better strategy in a newer version.

I also still have to include "reneging" in the game.
